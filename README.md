# Aerodis Space App: Web Frontend (Landing Page) & Cross-Platform Application

## Description

Aerodis Space App is a comprehensive platform designed for aeromodeling enthusiasts to watch live streams and configure their aircrafts through smart devices, including smartphones and PCs. The app provides a seamless experience for users to engage with the community, monitor their aircrafts in real-time, and adjust settings on the go. Note that some features, particularly those involving code configuration and upload, are optimized for desktop use to ensure the highest level of control and flexibility.

## Features

### Live Streaming

- **Public & Private Streams**: Dive into a wide array of live streams available to all users or access exclusive private streams with a password. Similar to the Twitch app, Aerodis Space showcases video thumbnails for easy browsing and selection.
- **Sensor Data Streaming**: Not just video, watch live sensor data streams from aircrafts in a dedicated black screen interface. Users have the option to save this streaming data directly into a CSV file via WebAssembly for further analysis and record-keeping. (Note: This feature provides the best experience on desktop.)

### Code Configuration

- **Easy Setup**: Effortlessly configure your aircraft's SSID, PASSWORD, Aircraft-Token, and embedded device pins with a user-friendly interface. Select your desired settings, hit the compile button, and wait a few seconds.
- **Direct Upload**: Once compilation is complete, connect your device and select 'upload' to directly program your aircraft's embedded system with the new configurations. This streamlined process ensures that your aircraft is always running with the latest settings tailored to your preferences.

## Getting Started

To make the most out of Aerodis Space App, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the App**: Available for both desktop and mobile platforms. Ensure you download the appropriate version for your device.
2. **Explore Live Streams**: Navigate through the live stream section to find interesting flights or sensor data streams. Save any valuable data for your analysis.
3. **Configure Your Aircraft**: Use the code configuration feature to customize your aircraft settings. This feature is optimized for desktop users for enhanced usability.

## Note

While Aerodis Space App is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, some advanced features, especially those related to code configuration and upload, are best utilized on a desktop environment. This ensures that users have all the necessary tools and screen space to efficiently manage their aircraft's settings and firmware.
